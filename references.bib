@article{Rebrov2002,
abstract = {The ammonia oxidation reaction on supported polycrystalline platinum catalyst was investigated in an aluminum-based microreactor. An extensive set of reactions was included in the chemical reactor modeling to facilitate the construction of a kinetic model capable of satisfactory predictions for a wide range of conditions (NH$_3$ partial pressure, 0.01-0.12atm; O$_2$ partial pressure, 0.10-0.88atm; temperature, 523-673K; contact time, 0.3-0.7ms). The elementary surface reactions used in developing the mechanism were chosen based on the literature data concerning ammonia oxidation on a Pt catalyst. Parameter estimates for the kinetic model were obtained using multi-response least squares regression analysis using the isothermal plug-flow reactor approximation. To evaluate the model, the behavior of a microstructured reactor was simulated by means of a complete Navier-Stokes model accounting for the reactions on the catalyst surface and the effect of temperature on the physico-chemical properties of the reacting mixture. In this way, the effect of the catalytic wall temperature non-uniformity and the effect of a boundary layer on the ammonia conversion and selectivity were examined. After further optimization of appropriate kinetic parameters, the calculated selectivities and product yields agree very well with the values actually measured in the microreactor. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Robinson1986,
abstract = {We present x-ray-diffraction profiles from a variety of different crystals which are characteristically diffuse in the direction perpendicular to the surface through which the incident and diffracted beams pass, but sharp in both parallel directions. We show that these effects arise from truncation of the crystal lattice at the surface. To explain the precise form of the momentum-transfer depen- dence of the intensity across the reciprocal-space zone, it is necessary to include the effects of surface roughness on an atomic scale. Such measurements therefore allow highly sensitive roughness determinations to be made. Understanding the origin of these streaks of intensity will have significant impact on the practice of x-ray crystallographic determinations of surface structure},

@article{Resta2020a,
abstract = {The ammonia oxidation reaction over a PtRh binary alloy has been studied with a surface science approach by operando techniques such as near-ambient pressure X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) and surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD) combined with mass spectrometry. The article will explore the surface evolution across five different oxygen to ammonia ratios in the millibar regime for two different temperatures. The presented data set allows us to link variations in the atomic structures measured by diffraction methods and surface species information from NAP-XPS to reaction products in the gas phase. We will show that NO production coincides with significant changes of the surface structure and the formation of a RhO$_2$ surface oxide. It was also observed that the RhO$_2$ surface oxide only fully forms when the nitrogen signal in the N1s has disappeared.},
